      <p>This API allows you to do most of the tasks that come to mind, you can't do without restrictions, but we don't even pay for it! The most interesting thing is that in addition to the extensive capabilities of <strong>JSONPlaceholder</strong>, it provides quick stub data with which you can test your application. You can learn more about the features in GitHub. I'll just list what I managed to do: pagination, search, data, filters by price or categories, sorting, the ability to make PUT POST requests and change data!</p>
