      <p>Cool API for implementing your application. A lot of data and opportunities to work with them. You can make pagination, not the most convenient way, but you can. If you try, you can make a copy of <strong>GoogleBooks</strong> because our API is used for it. The problems I encountered are, for example, the inability to make filters. And also in the JSON data part there is HTML code, which personally broke the layout for me.</p>
