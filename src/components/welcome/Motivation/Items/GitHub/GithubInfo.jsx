      <p>The idea behind my project is simple. I want to develop a big application. Initially, I just wanted to imitate the <strong>Google API</strong> that I encountered on a test task. It seemed to me interesting, but with shortcomings. I found <strong>JSONPlaceholder</strong> and the possibilities of its API surprised me. For the foreseeable future, I want to migrate to TypeScript. Add authorization, maybe I'll find another API for this. There is an idea to try to make applications with microfrontends.</p>
